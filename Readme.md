# Car park

## General outline

In the current iteration of this project a carpark has been made without a front-end, this project can only be run from an IDE. The project contains vehicle types, a parkingLot, a vehicleFactory and methods for each of these. Vehicle exits will soon be explored.

This project is currently in a prototype stage, it is currently a fully functioning carpark excluding vehicle exits, this will soon be implemented. A naive approach has been taken and the parkingType class has not yet been implemented, to conform to OOP standards I will soon be implementing this.
