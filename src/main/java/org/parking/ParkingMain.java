// Create a class ParkingLot
// Create a class ParkingSpot
// Add motorcycle, car, large enums as spotType to parkingSpot
// Add motorcycleParking, carParking and largeParking to ParkingLot
// Create each field as a list to contain ParkingSpot to dictate if parking is taken
// Create a method which tells us how many spots are remaining
// Create a method which tells us how many total spots are in the parking lot
// Create a method which tells us when the parking lot is full
// Create a method which tells us when the parking lot is empty
// Create a method which tells us when certain spots are full e.g. when all motorcycle spots are taken
// Create a method which tells us how many spots vans are taking up
//

//------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The parking lot can hold motorcycles, cars and vans
// The parking lot has motorcycle spots, car spots and large spots
// A motorcycle can park in any spot
// A car can park in a single compact spot, or a regular spot
// A van can park, but it will take up 3 regular spots
// These are just a few assumptions. Feel free to ask your interviewer about more assumptions as needed
